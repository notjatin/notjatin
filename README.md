## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Let's just stay there.
First, let me *introduce* myself:
> My real name is RG. Short for rusgranics.
> I am just starting to develop some things on my own.
> I have no experience of the workflow.
> So, I will be experimenting and following my instincts.

### Current goal:
* A children friendly application to visualize data structures and play with them.
* Although the main idea is to develop a similar application, to visualize algorithms instead, this is one heck of a start.
* We will be visualizing **arrays**, **stacks**, **queues** and **linked-lists** first.
* We will go on to visualize some higher order structures viz., **the trees**, **graphs**, **heaps** and so on.

### General Info
* If you are looking to contribute*, please reach out either on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/notjatin) or raise an issue.
* If you feel you are not ready to contribute yet, do not contribute. Instead, reach out to me and share your thoughts on contemporary world (we discuss philosophy).
* That's all.

### But also
I forgot about the tech stack.
* HTML5 is a must as we know.
* CSS is a must as we also know.
* Why not include JS too.
* And that's almost all. ðŸ˜„
